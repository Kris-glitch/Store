MorphoStore - ASP.NET Core App

MorphoStore is a jewlery app that uses ASP .NET Core framework and RESTful principles for the creation of the REST endpoints and Entity framework with SQLite for the Data base management. It is written in C# using Async programming and dependency injection.

Key Features:

RESTful API: MorphoStore uses a REST client to create RESTful endpoints, facilitating smooth and efficient communication between the client and server.

Entity Framework with SQLite: Entity Framework Core, combined with SQLite, provides a reliable and lightweight solution for database management. This setup ensures that data is handled efficiently and securely.

Asynchronous Programming: The use of async/await patterns allows MorphoStore to handle high concurrency with optimal resource utilization, ensuring the application remains responsive and performs well under load.

Dependency Injection: Utilizing dependency injection promotes a modular and maintainable codebase, making it easier to manage, test, and extend the application.

CRUD Operations: MorphoStore provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing jewelry items, categories, and collections, making it easy to keep the inventory up-to-date.

Technology Stack:

ASP.NET Core: The core framework provides a powerful, cross-platform solution for building modern web applications and APIs.

C#: The primary programming language used to implement the backend logic, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase.

Entity Framework Core: This ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) framework facilitates database operations, making data access straightforward and efficient.

SQLite: A lightweight, file-based database that ensures quick and easy setup and deployment.

Async/Await: Asynchronous programming patterns are employed to improve performance and scalability by preventing thread blocking.

Dependency Injection: Promotes loose coupling and enhances testability by injecting dependencies into classes instead of hardcoding them.
